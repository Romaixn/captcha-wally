# Where's Wally ?
Nowadays, we are often confronted with "Captcha".

These tests to know if we are robots or not.

They are all very boring and not very fun.

Imagine a world where to submit a form on your favorite site, you have to find Wally (or Waldo or Charlie).

Yes, you know this guy:

[![Wally](docs/wally.jpeg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Where%27s_Wally%3F)
